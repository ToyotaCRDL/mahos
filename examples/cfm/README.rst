CFM
===

Example configuration files of confocal fluorescence microscope (CFM) system
with optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) feature for color center research.

- Rather featureful (complex) example: ``conf.toml``
- Almost same but with different instruments: ``conf_alt.toml``
- Reduced (simpler) example: ``conf_simple.toml``
